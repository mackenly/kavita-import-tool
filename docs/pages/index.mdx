![icon](../../src-tauri/icons/Square310x310Logo.png)

## Description
Kavita Import Tool allows users to import a variety of eBook, manga, and image files and export them into the correct [folder structure for Kavita](https://wiki.kavitareader.com/guides/scanner/managefiles). When multiple files are imported with the same name, the program picks the best format or the format selected by the user.

The tool currently supports simple file name-based structures like the one below. If you have a different structure you would like to see supported, please [create an issue](https://gitub.com/mackenly/kavita-import-tool/issues/new) with the details.

Example folder structure:
```
kavita-import-tool-output-[epoch time]
  ┖── LearningAssemblyLanguage
        ┖── LearningAssemblyLanguage.epub 
      RustForTypeScriptDevelopers
          ┖── RustForTypeScriptDevelopers.pdf
      DesigningMultimediaPipelinesWithGStreamer
          ┖── DesigningMultimediaPipelinesWithGStreamer.cbz
```
