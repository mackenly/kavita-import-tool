# Development Notes
These are some notes that I have taken while developing the Kavita Import Tool. 
They are mostly for my reference, but may be useful if you are looking to contribute to the project.

## Kavita's Supported files

    public const string ArchiveFileExtensions = @"\.cbz|\.zip|\.rar|\.cbr|\.tar.gz|\.7zip|\.7z|\.cb7|\.cbt";
    public const string EpubFileExtension = @"\.epub";
    public const string PdfFileExtension = @"\.pdf";
```

## Update Server 
Using [mackenly/tauri-upade-cloudflare](https://github.com/mackenly/tauri-update-cloudflare/) hosted by TMG

Checks: https://updates.kavitaimporttool.mackenly.com/v1/{{target}}/{{arch}}/{{current_version}}

Even if the URL is changed, this one should be kept or redirected so that old versions can still check for updates.


## To Update the Version
Only the project maintainer should update the version.
1. Update the version in `tauri.conf.json`
2. Update the version in `Cargo.toml`
3. Commit the changes and let the CI/CD create a prerelease
4. Once the release is created, update the release to a full release for production distribution
