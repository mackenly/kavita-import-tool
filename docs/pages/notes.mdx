# Development Notes
These are some notes that I have taken while developing the Kavita Import Tool. 
They are mostly for my reference, but may be useful if you are looking to contribute to the project.

App is currently on Tauri v1. v2's docs are still incomplete so holding off on that.

## Kavita's Supported files
Link: [Disucssion link](https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/discussions/2949#discussioncomment-9693479)

Contents ([from here](https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/blob/094e775f0b2b1e7a7001928b5e68be86b33b90b1/API/Services/Tasks/Scanner/Parser/Parser.cs#L16)):
```cs
public const string ImageFileExtensions = @"^(\.png|\.jpeg|\.jpg|\.webp|\.gif|\.avif)"; 
    public const string ArchiveFileExtensions = @"\.cbz|\.zip|\.rar|\.cbr|\.tar.gz|\.7zip|\.7z|\.cb7|\.cbt";

## Update Server 
Using [mackenly/tauri-update-cloudflare](https://github.com/mackenly/tauri-update-cloudflare/) hosted by TMG

Checks: https://updates.kavitaimporttool.mackenly.com/v1/{{target}}/{{arch}}/{{current_version}}

Even if the URL is changed, this one should be kept or redirected so that old versions can still check for updates.


## Version updates
Version updates and deployments happen automatically on `main`. To control the synmantic versioning, there's special keywords that can be used in the commit messages:
```bash
patch-wording: 'bump-patch,fixes,Fixes,bugfix,Bugfix,patch,hotfix,Hotfix'
minor-wording: 'bump-minor,adds,Adds,new'
major-wording: 'bump-major,MAJOR,removes,Removes,delete,Delete'
```
