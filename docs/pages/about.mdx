# About

This tool was created to fix a thrustration I had with importating books into Kavita. The tool creates the correct file structure for Kavita and allows you automatically import the best format with ease. 

After creating the file strucutre, you simply need to upload the folders to your Kavita server and the books will be read for Kavita to start processing.
