# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

No versions are explicitly supported (see license). However, you should always use the latest version since it will contain the most recent security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for wanting to report a vulnerability. To get in touch, please go to [Tricities Media Group's contact form](https://tricitiesmediagroup.com/contact) and select "Security" as the purpose. This will go straight to one of the maintainers. 

If this is a vulnerability of an upstream dependency, we certainly want to do what we can to update those dependencies to minimize the risk to our users.

Thanks!
